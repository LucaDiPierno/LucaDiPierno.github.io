### Reflections on Teamwork and Leadership

Beyond the technical aspects, this project has been a formative experience in leading interdisciplinary collaboration under real-world constraints. From aligning hardware-software interfaces to defining mission strategies and resolving failures in the field, the journey demanded constant adaptation, clear communication, and a shared vision within the team.

I would like to thank the brilliant students who made this possible:

<ul>
    <li>Gilbert Tanner</li>
    <li>Georg Steinthaler</li>
    <li>Tim Schumann</li>
    <li>Ben Wesse</li>
    <li>Jonas Spieler</li>
</ul>

Your dedication, creativity, and resilience shaped this project from the initial concept to a system ready for real-world deployment.
