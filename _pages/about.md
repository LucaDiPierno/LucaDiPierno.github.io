Welcome 

Welcome to my personal website.

This platform serves as a central hub for my work in robotics, autonomy, and intelligent systems. Here you’ll find an overview of my research projects, technical blog posts, academic publications, and other resources related to autonomous aerial and space robotics.

Please note that this website is still under active development — some sections are incomplete or may change in the near future.

Thank you for your interest, and feel free to explore what's already available.

Current Role 

PhD researcher at the **Control of Networked Systems Group**, led by Professor Stephan Weiss — a contributor to the Ingenuity Mars Helicopter.  
I am also leading student teams in international robotics competitions and collaborate closely with JPL researchers.

Feel free to connect or explore my [GitHub Profile](https://github.com/LucaDiPierno) for more details.

Write your biography here. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com). You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any of these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](https://fontawesome.com/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them. -->
