# Welcome 

Welcome to my personal website.

This platform serves as a central hub for my work in robotics, autonomy, and intelligent systems. Here you’ll find an overview of my research projects, technical blog posts, academic publications, and other resources related to autonomous aerial and space robotics.

Please note that this website is still under active development — some sections are incomplete or may change in the near future.

Thank you for your interest, and feel free to explore what's already available.

# Current Role 

PhD researcher at the **Control of Networked Systems Group**, led by Professor Stephan Weiss — a contributor to the Ingenuity Mars Helicopter.  
I am also leading student teams in international robotics competitions and collaborate closely with JPL researchers.
